//! Coloured model pill widget — the "[opus]", "[sonnet]", "[haiku]" tag,
//! plus the secondary "permission-mode" pill (`PLAN`, `BYPASS`, `ACCEPT`).
//!
//! A tiny renderer that converts a model family into a single [`Span`] coloured
//! to match the website mockup: peach for Opus, teal for Sonnet, blue for
//! Haiku, mauve for anything we don't recognise. Text is always `crust` (dark)
//! so foreground/background contrast stays readable.
//!
//! The pill is rendered as `[name]` rather than with block glyphs so it
//! reflows cleanly in any row layout and stays legible at 4-6 chars wide
//! (the brief called that out explicitly).
//!
//! **v2.2 polish:** the default pill is now a *chip* — a block-character
//! frame `▌opus▐` where the left/right half-blocks read as a tinted border
//! and the middle is the same family colour on a darker `surface0` bed so
//! the chip visually floats above the row. Falls back to the flat pill via
//! [`flat_pill`] when the caller is on a background that already uses
//! `surface0` (toasts, modals) and the chip effect would vanish.
